## Instructions

From 1925 through 1963, Burma Shave advertising signs appeared next to highways across the United States.
There were always four or five signs in a row containing pieces of a rhyme, followed by a final sign that read Burma Shave.

For example, one set of signs that has been preserved by the Smithsonian Institution reads as follows:

```text
Shaving brushes
You’ll soon see ’em
On a shelf
In some museum
Burma Shave
```

Find a classic Burma Shave rhyme on the Web, making sure the fifth line is Burma Shave.
Write, compile, and test a class called BurmaShave that displays the slogan.

## Grading Criterion

Tasks

- Create the BurmaShave class.
- The BurmaShave program uses the println() method to print a rhyme with the last line being Burma Shave.
