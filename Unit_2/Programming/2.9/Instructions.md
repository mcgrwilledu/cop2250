## Instructions

Write a program that allows the user to enter an integer number of dollars and calculates and displays the conversion into currency denominationsâ€”20s, 10s, 5s, and 1s.
Save the program as **Dollars.java**.

The conversion algorithm should return the smallest number of bills needed for the conversion.
For example, $15 should break down into 1 $10 and 1 $5.

An example of the program is shown below:

```text
Enter a number of dollars 3025
$3025 converted is 151 $20s, 0 $10s, 1 $5s, and 0 $1s
```

## Grading Criterion
