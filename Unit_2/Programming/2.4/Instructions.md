# Programming Exercise 2.4

## How to Use the Code Editor

1. Select the "Run Code" button to execute the program.
2. Select the "Calculate Grade" button to generate a score based on the completed tasks.
3. Continue to modify, run, and calculate your code until you are happy with the grade.
4. Select the "Submit" button to turn in the assignment to your instructor.

## Instructions

### Part A

Write a program named QuartsToGallons that declares a named constant (QUARTS_IN_GALLONS) to hold the number of quarts in a gallon (4).
Declare a variable to represent the number of quarts needed for a painting job.
Name the variable quartsNeeded, and assign 18 to it.
Compute and display the number of gallons and quarts needed for the job.
Display explanatory text in the format shown in the following example.
Save the program as **QuartsToGallons.java**.

An example of the program is shown below:

```text
A job that needs 18 quarts requires 4 gallons plus 2 quarts.
```

### Part B

Convert the QuartsToGallons program to an interactive application called QuartsToGallonsInteractive by copying the file contents from one to the other.
Instead of assigning a value to the number of quarts, accept the value from the user as input.
Save the revised program as **QuartsToGallonsInteractive.java**.

An example of the program is shown below:

```text
Enter quarts needed >> 157
A job that needs 157 quarts requires 39 gallons plus 1 quarts.
```
