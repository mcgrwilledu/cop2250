## Instructions

**Part A**

Write a program that declares named constants to represent the number of inches, feet, and yards in a mile.
Also declare a variable named miles to represent a number of miles and assign a value to it.
Compute and display, with explanatory text, the value in inches, feet, and yards.
Save the program as **MileConversions.java**.

**Part B**

Convert the MileConversions program to an interactive application.
Instead of assigning a value to the miles variable, accept the value from the user as input.
Save the revised program as **MileConversionsInteractive.java**.

## Grading Criterion
