## Questions

Suppose that you have created a program with only the following variables.

```java
int x = 2;

int y = 3;
```

Suppose that you also have a method with the following header:

```java
public static void mathMethod(int x)
```

Which of the following method calls are legal?

1. mathMethod(x);
    - [x] legal.   `method takes an integer.`
    - [ ] illegal.

2. mathMethod(y);
    - [x] legal.   `method takes an integer.`
    - [ ] illegal.

3. mathMethod(x, y);
    - [ ] legal.
    - [x] illegal. `method does not take two arguments.`

4. mathMethod(x + y);
    - [x] legal.   `method takes an integer.`
    - [ ] illegal.

5. mathMethod(12L);
    - [ ] legal.
    - [x] illegal. `method does not take an argument of type long.`

6. mathMethod(12);
    - [x] legal.   `method takes an integer.`
    - [ ] illegal.

7. mathMethod(12.2);
    - [ ] legal.
    - [x] illegal. `method does not take an argument of type double.`

8. mathMethod();
    - [ ] legal.
    - [x] illegal. `method requires an argument.`

9. mathMethod(a);
    - [ ] legal.
    - [x] illegal. `program does not have a variable named a.`

10. mathMethod(a / x);
    - [ ] legal.
    - [x] illegal. `program does not have a variable named a.`
