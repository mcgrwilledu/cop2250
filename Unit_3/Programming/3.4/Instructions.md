# Programming Exercise 3.4

## How to Use the Code Editor

1. Select the "Run Code" button to execute the program.
2. Select the "Calculate Grade" button to generate a score based on the completed tasks.
3. Continue to modify, run, and calculate your code until you are happy with the grade.
4. Select the "Submit" button to turn in the assignment to your instructor.

## Book Instructions

Create an application named Percentages whose `main()` method holds two double variables, and prompt the user for values.
Pass both variables to a method named `computePercent()` that displays the two values and the value of the first number as a percentage of the second one.
For example, if the numbers are 2.0 and 5.0, the method should display a statement similar to 2.0 is 40 percent of 5.0.
Then call the method a second time, passing the values in reverse order.
Save the application as **Percentages.java**.

## Companion Instructions

Create a class named `Percentages` whose `main()` method holds two `double` variables, and prompt the user for values.
Pass both variables to a method named `computePercent()` that displays the two values and the value of the first number as a percentage of the second one.
For example, if the numbers are **2.0** and **5.0**, the method should display a statement similar to: 2.0 is 40 percent of 5.0.
Then call the method a second time, passing the values in reverse order.

An example of the program is shown below:

```text
Enter a double >> 3.7
Enter another double >> 12.3
3.7 is 30.081300813008127 percent of 12.3
12.3 is 332.43243243243245 percent of 3.7
```

## Grading Criterion

Tasks

**Task 01:**  Create the `Percentages` class.  
**Task 02:**  The `computePercent()` method displays the percent of the first argument of the second argument.  
**Task 03:**  The `Percentages` program accepts 2 `double` values from the console and displays the percent of first value of the second value and vice versa.
