# Programming Exercise 3.9

## How to Use the Code Editor

1. Select the "Run Code" button to execute the program.
2. Select the "Calculate Grade" button to generate a score based on the completed tasks.
3. Continue to modify, run, and calculate your code until you are happy with the grade.
4. Select the "Submit" button to turn in the assignment to your instructor.

## Book Instructions

The Renew Your Home Company estimates each job cost as the cost of materials plus $35 per hour while on the job, plus $12 per hour for travel time to the job site. Create a class that contains a `main()` method that prompts the user for the name of a job (for example, Patel bathroom remodel), the cost of materials, the number of hours of work required, and the number of hours of travel time. Pass the numeric data to a method that computes an estimate for the job and returns the computed value to the `main()` method, where the job name and estimated price are displayed. Save the program as **JobPricing.java**.

## Companion Instructions

The Renew Your Home Company estimates each job cost as the cost of materials plus $35 per hour while on the job, plus $12 per hour for travel time to the job site. Create a class called `JobPricing` that contains a `main()` method that prompts the user for the name of a job (for example, Patel bathroom remodel), the cost of materials as a `double`, the number of hours of work required as a `double`, and the number of hours of travel time as a `double`. Pass the numeric data to a method called `computePrice()` that computes an estimate for the job and returns the computed value to the `main()` method, where the job name and estimated price are displayed.

An example of the program is shown below:
```
Enter job description >> Apartment 23A renovation
Enter cost of materials >> 2300
Enter hours on the job work >> 35.5
Enter hours traveling >> 2
The price for Apartment 23A renovation is $3566.5
```

## Grading Criterion

Tasks

**Task 01:**  Create the `JobPricing` class.
**Task 02:**  The `computePrice()` method returns the estimate for a job.
**Task 03:**  The `JobPricing` program displays the job estimate details.
