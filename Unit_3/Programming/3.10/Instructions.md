4. Select the "Submit" button to turn in the assignment to your instructor.

## Book Instructions

Create a class named `FormLetterWriter` that includes two overloaded methods named `displaySalutation()`. The first method takes one `String` parameter that represents a customer’s first name, and it displays the salutation **Dear** followed by the first name. The second method accepts two `String` parameters that represent a first and last name, and it displays the greeting **Dear** followed by the first name, a space, and the last name. After each salutation, display the rest of a short business letter: **Thank you for your recent order**. Write a `main()` method that prompts the user for a first and last name and tests each overloaded method. Save the file as **FormLetterWriter.java**.

## Companion Instructions

Create a class named `FormLetterWriter` that includes two overloaded methods named `displaySalutation()`.

The first method takes one `String` parameter that represents a customer’s first name, and it displays the salutation **Dear** followed by the first name.

The second method accepts two `String` parameters that represent a first and last name, and it displays the salutation **Dear** followed by the first name, a space, and the last name.

After each salutation, display the rest of a short business letter: **Thank you for your recent order**.

Write a `main()` method that prompts the user for a first and last name and tests each overloaded method.

An example of the program is shown below:
```
Enter first name >> Jane
Enter last name >> Doe
Dear Jane,
   Thank you for your recent order.

Dear Jane Doe,
   Thank you for your recent order.
```

## Grading Criterion
