## Book Instructions

To encourage good grades, Hermosa High School has decided to award each student a bookstore credit that is 10 times the student’s grade point average.
In other words, a student with a 3.2 grade point average receives a $32 credit.
Create a class that prompts a student for a name and grade point average and then passes the values to a method that displays a descriptive message.
The message uses the student’s name, echoes the grade point average, and computes and displays the credit.
Save the application as **BookstoreCredit.java**.

## Companion Instructions

To encourage good grades, Hermosa High School has decided to award each student a bookstore credit that is **10** times the student’s grade point average.
In other words, a student with a **3.2** grade point average receives a **$32.0** credit.
Create a class called `BookstoreCredit` that prompts a student for a name and grade point average and then passes the values to a method called `computeDiscount()` that displays a descriptive message.
The message uses the student’s name, echoes the grade point average, and computes and displays the credit.

An example of the program is shown below:
```
Enter your name >> Jane Doe
Enter your gpa >> 3.6
Jane Doe, your GPA is 3.6, so your discount is $36.0
```

## Grading Criterion

Tasks

**Task 01:**  Create the `BookstoreCredit` class.
**Task 02:**  The `computeDiscount` method calculates a discount based on a student's GPA.
**Task 03:**  The `BookstoreCredit` program displays the discount for the student's information.
