# Programming Exercise 3.3

## How to Use the Code Editor

1. Select the "Run Code" button to execute the program.
2. Select the "Calculate Grade" button to generate a score based on the completed tasks.
3. Continue to modify, run, and calculate your code until you are happy with the grade.
4. Select the "Submit" button to turn in the assignment to your instructor.

## Book Instructions

Create an application named NumbersDemo whose `main()` method holds two integer variables.
Prompt the user for values for the variables.
In turn, pass each value to methods named `displayTwiceTheNumber()`, `displayNumberPlusFive()`, and `displayNumberSquared()`.
Create each method to perform the task its name implies.
Save the application as **NumbersDemo.java**.

## Companion Instructions

Create a class named `NumbersDemo` whose `main()` method holds two integer variables.
Prompt the user for values for the variables.
In turn, pass each value to methods named `displayTwiceTheNumber()`, `displayNumberPlusFive()`, and `displayNumberSquared()`.
Create each method to perform the task its name implies.

An example of the program is shown below: 

```text
Enter an integer >> 5
Enter another integer >> 93
5 times 2 is 10
5 plus 5 is 10
5 squared is 25
93 times 2 is 186
93 plus 5 is 98
93 squared is 8649
```

## Grading Criterion

Tasks

**Task 01:**  Create the `NumbersDemo` class.  
**Task 02:**  The `displayTwiceTheNumber()` method multiples a number by **2**.  
**Task 03:**  The `displayNumberPlusFive()` method adds **5** to the argument.  
**Task 04:**  The `displayNumberSquared()` method squares the argument.  
**Task 05:**  The `NumbersDemo` program accepts two integer input values and displays the correct output after each method.
